# React Lottery Generator

A Lottery number generator made with React. It uses a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) to avoid duplicate numbers.

Fixed a bug that was causing more than 6 balls to appear on screen and numbers where duplicating.
